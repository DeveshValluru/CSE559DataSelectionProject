This folder contains the code to filter the dataset for length variation on the sequence level. Specifically, since these sequences are very short, it bins the sequences by length with bin sizes of 1. It then calculates how much data each bin should be capped at to maintain a 60% split of the data. Then, It will go through bin by bin and pick a random selection without replacement of that bin's data if it exceeds the cap. In this way, the lengths should be as uniform as possible without creating duplicate datapoints. It then writes this new pool of data into a separate folder to be used by the embedding model. This folder also contains the results of using this embedding model on a downstream task.
